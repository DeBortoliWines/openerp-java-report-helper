OpenERP Java Report Helper
==========================

This library hopes to provide a helper class to be used by any Java based reporting tool like Jasper/Pentaho.

The library provides a Java Swing user interface for data source configuration and a data interface for data collection. A Java report client needs to control the workflow and persistence of the configuration information while the library will handle data source configuration and data collection.
